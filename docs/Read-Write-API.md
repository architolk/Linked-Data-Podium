# Read-write Linked Data API
With regard to Linked Data API's three standards have emerged:

- [Linked data concept itself](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html)
- [SPARQL Graph Update](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update)
- [Linked Data Platform](http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp)

The Linked data concept itself states "When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards". This implies a RESTful API for GET http operations. The concept doesn't give directions how to update Linked Data resources (http operations like PUT, POST and DELETE).

The SPARQL Graph Update protocol is part of the SPARQL1.1 standaard. It gives directions what to do when to GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, PATCH or DELETE data to a named graph.

The Linked Data Platform gives directions what to do when to GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, PATCH, OPTIONS or DELETE data to a resource.

As stated in the specification of the Linked Data Platform, the two standards can be used together, but some precautions must be made. The two standards differ conceptually: a named graph versus a resource.

The Read-Write Linked Data API is a proposal to create an API specification that combines the three standards.

### RESTful web API's
Formally, an _API_ is an Application Programmers Interface (something that you program against), a _web API_ is an Application Programmers Interface that can be accessed using the http protocol and a _RESTful web API_ is an Application Programmers Interface that can be accessed using the http protocol and adhers to the [Representational State Transfer (REST) constraints](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm), as defined by Roy Fielding. From this formal definition, the Read-Write Linked Data API is - for the most part - a RESTful web API.

However, in reality, the term "REST API" is often used for any request that can be made via http and returns some kind of json result. So in reality, the Read-Write Linked Data API is also a RESTful web API, because the API will return json-ld, which formally is a json format.

There's a catch however: despite the huge effort by the authors of the json-ld recommendation, most json-API users would prefer a more "closed model" version of the returned data, with nesting when applicable. They would like an [Open API Specification](https://www.openapis.org) which describes the way the returned data would look, which would probably *not* be json-ld, but plain json that conforms to a certain, API specific, scheme.

The Linked Data API should also support these kind of API's. A mapping between the fields defined in an Open API specification and the linked data should be provided to translate a json-ld document to the requested json document.

## Linked Data concept
- `GET {URI}` returns useful information about a resource that is described by the information-resource identified by {URI}.
- `GET {URI}#{fragment}` returns useful information contained in the information-resource identified by {URI}. At least information about the resource identified by {URI}#{fragment} should be present.
- `GET {URI}` returns a 303 to the information resource that describes a non-information resource identified by {URI}.

The Linked Data concept doesn't really give directions how to access a resource that cannot be dereferenced (such as URN's). A best practice for these situations might be:

- `GET /resource?subject={URI}` returns useful information about a resource identified by {URI}.

A best practice with regard to "userful information about a resource" is the [Concise Bounded Description (CBD)](http://www.w3.org/Submission/CBD) of a resource.

A key concept is the distinction between a non-information resource and an information-resource (see: [the architecture of the world-wide-web, section 2.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch#id-resources)). Non-information resources (real-life things or abstract concepts) cannot be returned via the http protocol. Non-information resources are associated with one or more information resources that describe the non-information resource.

![resources.png](resources.png)

The car on the left cannot be returned via the http protocol: it's not information, it's a real-life thing. According to the Linked Data concept, it is a non-information resource, and can be identified by a URI. The turtle document on the right can be returned via the http protocol: it's an information-resource. This particular information resource is a description of the real-life car on the left.

The URI on the right refers to the information about the car, but might also refer to information about this information itself (metadata), for example: the date at which the information was registered. Because this information is of a specific point in time, the URI for this information would probably also contain a timestamp:

	@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/>.
	@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>.
	@prefix wdrs: <http://www.w3.org/2007/05/powder-s#>.
	@prefix prov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#>.
	@prefix dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>.
	<http://example.org/id/car/somecar> a schema:Car;
		rdfs:label "some car";
		schema:color "red";
		wdrs:describedby <http://example.org/doc/20120403133523/car/somecar>
	. 
	<http://example.org/doc/20170403133523/car/somecar> a prov:Entity;
		prov:generatedAtTime "2017-04-03T13:35:23Z"^^xsd:dateTime;
		dct:isVersionOf <http://example.org/doc/car/somecar>
	.
	
With this example, versioning is introduced. This might also raise the question: "which information is refered to when using a non-versioned URI?". The best practice is to return the most recent version. This means that the response above might be the response for both the URIs `http://example.org/doc/car/somecar` and `http://example.org/doc/20170403133523/car/somecar`.

## SPARQL Graph Update
- `GET {URI}` returns the set of triples contained in a named graph identified by {URI}.
- `GET /{access-point}?graph={URI}` returns the set of triples contained in a named graph identified by {URI}. The access-point can be any URL.
- `PUT {URI}` replaces the content of a named graph identified by {URI}.
- `PUT /{access-point}?graph={URI}` replaces the content of a named graph identified by {URI}.
- `POST {URI}` merges the content of a named graph identified by {URI}.
- `POST /{access-point}?graph={URI}` merges the content of a named graph identified by {URI}.
- `DELETE {URI}` deletes the content of a named graph identified by {URI}.
- `DELETE /{access-point}?graph={URI}` deletes the content of a named graph identified by {URI}.

## Linked Data Platform

#### Plain resources

- `GET {URI}` returns the content of an information resource identified by {URI}.
- `PUT {URI}` replaces the content of an information resource identified by {URI}.
- `POST {URI}` merges the content of an information resource identified by {URI}.
- `DELETE {URI}` deletes the content of an information resource identified by {URI}.

#### Container resources

- `GET {URI}` returns the content of a container information resource.
- `POST {URI}` adds a new information resource (a member) to a container information resource, and returns the newly minted URI of this information resource member.

The Linked Data Platform defines three different types of containers. Some extra triples might be created, dependent on the type of container:

- Basis container: no extra triples are created;
- Direct container: an extra membership triple is created between the subject of the container (might be a non-information resource) and the newly created container;
- Indirect container: an extra membership triple is created between the subject of the container (might be a non-information resource) and a member related resource (might be a non-information resource, different from the original member URI).

## strict RESTful API's

- `GET /{collection}/{id}` returns the content of an information resource identified by {id}, within the collection identified by {collection}.
- `GET /{collection}?id={id}` returns the content of an information resource identified by {id}, within the collection identified by {collection}.
- `GET /{collection}?{name}={value}` returns a list of information resources (and sometimes also the content) that corresponds a the filter. {name} should be some property, and {value} the value to be filtered. For example: `GET /addresses?zipcode=1234`. The list might be paged.
- `POST /{collection}` adds a new information resource to the collection.

Strict RESTful API's are very similar to the API provided by a Linked Data Platform. The most obvious distinction is the ommission of real URI's, and the introduction of collections and identifiers. However, most Linked Data URI's conform to a URI template that is quite similar to the way strict RESTful API's are organized. The most visible difference is the use of a plural form for the collection in case of an API, and the use of a singular form for the collection in case of an Linked Data URI. Another difference is the distinction between information resources and non-information resources

|-------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| API         | `https://example.org/api/buildings/12345` |                              |
| Linked Data | `https://example.org/doc/building/12345`  |Information about the building|
| Linked Data | `http://example.org/id/building/12345`    |The building itself           |

## Proposal for the read-write API

### Catagories of resources

For this proposal, we would like to make the distinction between some different categories of resources:

1. Non-information resources: resources that cannot be retrieved by a web server. The URI's for these resources are used as references.
2. REST-style information resources: resources that conform to a REST-style of interaction. These resources conform to the [Linked Data Platform](http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp) recommendation.
3. Multiple subject information resources: resources that correspond to a named graph. These resources conform to the [SPARQL Graph Update](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update) recommendation.
4. Query Non-REST information resources: resources that correspond to particular SPARQL queries.
5. Update Non-REST services: resources that envoke a particular SPARUL update query.

The proposal focusses on GET, POST, PUT and DELETE operations and should be compliant to the three standards mentioned at the beginning of this document.

The table below gives an overview of all resource types

| Id | Type                                  | Goal           | Typical URI template           | Allowed methods     | Response (happy flow)                          |
|----|---------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1A | Non-information resource, 303-style   | Reference      | `/id/{collection}/{reference}` | GET                 | 303 See other: `/doc/{collection}/{reference}` |
| 1B | Non-information resource, #-style     | Reference      | `/{document}#{reference}`      | -                   | See: `/{document}` (type-3) |
| 2A | Single subject information resource   | LDP/REST       | `/{collection}/{reference}     | GET,POST,PUT,DELETE | 200 Ok |
| 2B | Collection information resource       | LDP/REST       | `/{collection}                 | GET,POST,PUT,DELETE | 200 Ok, 201 Created |
| 3  | Multiple subject information resource | Graph protocol | `/{document}`                  | GET,POST,PUT,DELETE | 200 Ok |
| 4  | Query resources                       | SPARQL queries | `/{query}`                     | GET,POST-form       | 200 Ok |
| 5  | Production resources                  | SPARQL updates | `/{production}`                | GET,POST-form,POST  | 200 Ok |

A complete [spreadsheet version](Read-Write-API.xlsx) is also available.

As the type of resource cannot be determined by the URI, some server-side configuration is necessary to make the distinction. The use of `id` and `doc` for types 1A and 2A is recommended, but could be something completely different, as long as the URI for the non-information resource differs from the URI for the information resource.

The semantics of GET,POST,PUT and DELETE are properly defined in the http standard, but some ambiguity exists with regard to POST. Because the number of characters for a URI is limited, very large URI-parameters may also be transmitted as part of the body in a POST request (called a POST-form). In such a case, the content-type of the http requestbody should be `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`.

| Method    | Impact           |
| ----------|------------------|
| GET       | Safe (read only) |
| POST-form | Safe in case of a read action, Non-idempotent in case of a write action |
| PUT       | Idempotent (multiple requests should result in the same state) |
| POST      | Non-idempotent (multiple request may result in different states, like the creation of a new resource) |
| DELETE    | Idempotent (multiple request should result in the same state - the resource is gone) |

A POST-form request is considered the equivalent of a GET operation for all resources, except for a production resource. A GET to a production resource will result in a HTML form (`content-type=text/html`) or a specification of the service. A POST to a production resource will always result in the execution of the production.

### Extra functionality

Some extra functionality is proposed, on top of the standards. It should be possible not to use this extra functionality:

1. Assertions: validations should be possible agains PUT, POST and DELETE operations. If an assertion fails, a 409 Conflict http error should be returned;
2. Post-operations: it should be possible to perform some SPARQL update queries after the data is added.
3. Translations: not only RDF serializations should be possible to PUT or POST, but also other known formats. A specific translator per format should exist to translate the data to RDF.
4. Content negotiation to non-RDF serializations should be possible for GET operations. A specific transformation per format should exist to translate the data to a non-RDF serialization.
5. Versioning and metadata: it should be possible that data is inserted according to a know versioning-pattern.
6. Parameters: it should be possible to send extra parameters whenever data is uploaded (as part of a POST form or as URI-parameters).

### 1. Non-information resources
Non-information resources should be identified using a `id`-URI or a `#`-URI.

The use of `id`-URI's requires the existance of a URI-minting-strategy with a concise decision to reserve particular URI's as references to non-information resources. A best-practice is the following URI-minting template:

	http://{full-qualified-domain-name}/{path}/id/{collection}/{reference}

A `#`-URI is any URI with a fragment path, like:

	http://{full-qualified-domain-name}/{path}#{fragment}

- `GET` to a `id`-URI results in a 303 See Other to the corresponding information resource that describes this information resource.
- `GET` to a `#`-URI results in the retrieval (200 OK) of the corresponding information resource, identified by the URI without `#{fragment}`. 
- `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` result in 405 Method not allowed error.

### 2. LDP / RESTful API style resources
These resource should be [Linked Data Platform Resources](http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#ldpr), and as such operate als RESTful API's.

Two categories of basis information resources are proposed:

1. Information resources that describe a single (non-)information resource
2. Information resources that describe a collection of (non-)information resources.

#### 2A Single subject information resources
Single subject information resource are sometimes called `doc`-URI's because the best practice for minting these URI's is the use of a `doc` part.

- `GET` to a `doc`-URI results in the set of triples that are identified by this URI. This should be the CBD of the corresponding `id`-URI and the CBD of the `doc`-URI. Informatively: *the data and the metadata*.
- `PUT` to a `doc`-URI results in the replacement of the set of triples that are identified by this URI.
- `POST` to a `doc`-URI results in the merging of the set of triples that are identified by this URI.
- `DELETE` to a `doc`-URI results in the removal of the set of triples that are identified by this URI. 

### 2B Collection information resources

Collections resemble LDP-containers. From a collection, it is possible to create new resources. Typical collections have URI's that conform to the following pattern:

	http://{full-qualified-domain-name}/{path}/doc/{collection}

- `GET` to a collection-URI results in a paged list (200 Ok) of all resources in the collection. A filter can be added, which will give not only a list of resources, but also the CBD of the resources themselves.
- `PUT` to a collection-URI should replace the collection itself, and all its members. (This might not be an ideal operation...)
- `POST` to a collection-URI should create a new resource, based on the data in the body. The `POST` operation on a collection resembles the `PUT` operation on a single subject information resource, but will mint a URI's for the information resource and the non-information resources (`doc` versus `id` URI's). An 201 Created response code should be given, with the newly minted URI in the "location" field.
- `DELETE` to a collection-URi should delete the whole collection.

The first category corresponds with a `doc`-URI that is the description of a `id`-URI. The second category correponds with a `#`-URI that is the description of all the resources that only differ in the fragment-part.

### 3 Multiple subject information resources
Multiple subject information resources resemble named graphs and conform to the SPARQL Graph update protocol. Because a link to a `#`-URI will result in the retrieval of the URI-part before the `#`, all `#`-URI's result in the retrieval of a multiple subject information resource.

- `GET` to a container-URI results in the set of triples that are identified by this URI. This should be all the triples in the named graph that is identified by the same URI.
- `PUT` to a container-URI results in the replacement of the set of triples that are identified by this URI.
- `POST` to a container-URI results in the merging of the set of triples that are identified by this URI .
- `DELETE` to a container-URI results in the removal of the set of triples that are identified by this URI.

### 4 Non-REST Query resources

Query resources only respond to `GET` requests. A query resource resembles a particular SPARQL query that doesn't return a typical CBD, but might contain triples from multiple named graphs, or even a sparql-result-set.

- `GET` to a query resource results in a set of triples or a sparql result set. A 200 Ok response is given when the correct mime-type can be returned. A 406 reponse is given when the accept request header doesn't fit the typical response (sparql results sets cannot be converted to a turtle response and visa versa).
- `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` result in 405 Method not allowed error.

### 5 Non-REST Production resources

Production resources are resources that trigger the manipulation of data. The request may contain some content, but this not necessary. Production resources resemble one or more SPARQL Update queries.

- `GET` to a production resource will return a 200 Ok response with meta-information about the production resource, and a link how to perform the actual production (a `POST`-call).
- `POST` to a production resource will execute the production. A 200 Ok response is given when the execution has been succesful. The response body will contain information about the execution. In case of an error, a 409 Conflict response is given. 
- `PUT` and `DELETE` result in 405 Method not allowed error.
