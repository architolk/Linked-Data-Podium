# Docker build instructions
This document describes the steps to run the Linked Data Theatre with Docker.

A complete `dockercompose` file is already part of the Linked Data Theatre. The `dockercompose` file exists of 2 services/Docker containers:
- Tomcat container
- Virtuoso container

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have a recent docker installation ([www.docker.com](https://www.docker.com))
- Install Maven

## Create network in Docker

At the command line execute the following command:

    docker network create ldt

## Build and start the Docker containers

Start the containers with (the first time, the containers will be build, this can take some time):

    docker-compose up

Now virtuoso should be running (http://localhost:8890/conductor/) and Tomcat should be running but without LDT yet.

## Prepare the LDT

### Update stored procedures
_This step is only necessary if you use Virtuoso as a backend. Note that some functionality (mainly backstage and containers) is not available if you use a different backend._

Execute the following commands from your local machine:

    docker cp stored-procs/create_procedures.sql virtuoso:/var/tmp
    docker exec -it virtuoso sh -c 'isql -U dba -P dba < /var/tmp/create_procedures.sql'

### Adapt config for Docker
The default setup assumes Virtuoso and Tomcat run on the same server, but with Docker they communicate through the docker network. The LDT should be configured to use `virtuoso` (hostname) instead of `localhost`.

#### Adapt Context.xml
In the file `src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml`, replace `localhost` with `virtuoso`:
- `serverName="localhost"` -> `serverName="virtuoso"`
- `url="jdbc:virtuoso://localhost:1111/"` -> `url="jdbc:virtuoso://virtuoso:1111/"`

#### Adapt config.xml
In the file `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/resources/apps/ldt/config.xml` â€”

Replace 

    theatre env="dev" configuration-endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:8890/sparql" local-endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:8890/sparql" sparql="yes"

with

    theatre env="dev" configuration-endpoint="http://virtuoso:8890/sparql" local-endpoint="http://virtuoso:8890/sparql" sparql="yes"

## Build LDT
(For this step Maven should be installed; another options is to download the LDT war release, see DEPLOY.md)

To build LDT with Maven, do (TODO implement in Maven instead of separate script):

    bash build.sh

## Run LDT
1. Now ldt is up and running, so open the backstage in your browser with the url:
http://localhost:8080/backstage
2. Press import and select the file the basic-configuration.ttl 
3. Press Upload.
4. Now LDT front could be opened in your browser with:
http://localhost:8080/ldt/
